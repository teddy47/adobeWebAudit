# adobeWebAudit

I have done web audit on 'adobe' official web site &amp; related subdomains. Also covered up several vulnerabilities and suggest mitigations as well.Adobe domain I selected from hacker one site for my web audit. Adobe inc. is an international American technology
corporation for computers. Based in Delaware and located in San Jose , California, it has traditionally focused on the development of software products for entertainment and innovation, with a more recent foray into applications for digital marketing.

In our search to provide a safe and secure environment for Adobe 's customers, Adobe recognizes that the security
community is a force multiplier. To that end, security researchers contribute and aspire to have the best possible
experience of vulnerability disclosure.
